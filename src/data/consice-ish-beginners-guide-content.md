Getting Started With Your Own Editor
To actually get started with your own project install next.js

install node
run command: npm install react react-dom next
run command: npx create-next-app [name-of-project] --use-npm
run command: cd [name-of-project]
run command: npm run dev
this will open a browser window with your running react site
Then you can use this project as a sandbox to learn React or just to get started building a new project.

open pages/index.js

delete everything between the parens after return

you can now write your react code here

you can declare new components in this file too and use them
